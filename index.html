    <h2>Anita Dankwa</h2>
    <p>My name is Anita Dankwa.The career path which I am hoping to acquire is to be a certified web designer with a Bachelors degree<br> in Applied 
       Technology.My hobby is reading. I come from the Eastern part of Ghana and lives in the capital Accra.  
       I am married and <br>blessed with a child. I am an entrepreneur and a student trying to pursue my education at all cost.
        What I love most about BYU is, <br>they giving me the opprtuinity to acquire academic execellence in pursuing my education even when I taught it was 
        too late.The most <br>advantages of studying web design is the quick exposure to employment wherever you find 
        your self. My motive for taking this course <br> is to empower more females in my country to develope love for technology since 
        majority sees it to be mens programme to study and not <br>women. At the end,the positive impactation is what matters to me. My favorite scripture is taken from
         2 Nephi 9:28
